# ellipse_detect
Detect the cirles and ellipse of the tensile specimens before and after the tensile test.

It's so difficult to detect all the circles of the specimens.
I want to get the coordinate of every circle center and the corresponding radius for the picture before tensile test.

It's even more difficult to detect the ellipse after the specimens were tensiled.
I want to get the coordinate of every ellipse center and the corresponding length of a/x axis for the picture after tensile test.

If you can manage it, please contact me.
